# task or job.

# there are two variations of functions in python
# Built-in Functions- instructions that are pre-written in python 
# programing language 

# print() is a built in function. When we oass in data it will output 
# it into the terminal automatically.
print('Coding Class')

# input () is a built in function. It allows us to write and pass 
#dra into our program from the terminal
name= input("what is your name?")
print(name)

number= int(input('please provide a number'))
print(23^number)

# User Defined function- custom functions written by engineers

# Function Syntax- how it is written
# def is short for define
# this is a function definition

    print("step 1. get 2 pieces of bread,")
    print("step 2. putting ingredients inside of bread,")
