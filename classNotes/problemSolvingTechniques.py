# Challenges in software development are:
# Working with legacy code (old code)
# Developing a new piece of code to satisfy a specific feature
# Managing many peieces of code to work together

# How to Problem Solve

# Step 1: Read and Listen to understand
# Boil down the question to the key points to save time and trouble
# Make sure to take down notes of your thoughts

# Step 2: Locate keywords and phrases
# In most questions the answer is in it 
# Try to think about the context of the word as in "when" "here" and "how" you saw this word

# Step 3: Is there an input(data) in the question
# Does the question give you data to work with?

# Step 4: Does the problem require an output(data)
# Does the problem ask you to provide data as a result 

# Step 5: Pseudo Code your notes
# Pseudo code is a way of planning how you would solve the coding problem 
# When writing psuedo code your goal is to simply write down the steps you would take to 
# solve the problem but within the context of the coding language
# You are not actually writing the actual functional code when writing psuedo code
