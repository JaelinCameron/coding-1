# Boys Latin has hired you to develop a grade checker program for students. 
# Your program should be able to do the following; allow a student to enter a numerical grade, 
# then return the appropriate letter grade. For example; if a student enters the number 80, 
# the program should give back the letter grade "B".
# Your program should then repeat by  asking the user to enter another numerical grade.
# Each time a user enters another numerical grade, it should perform some calculation 
# to average out the grades and show the new letter grade, 
# For example: if the user enters the number 70, and the 100,
# they're average should be an 85, which is a B.

# 1. In a complete sentence, what is the problem asking you to do ?
# The problem is asking me to make a function where students can input a number and output a 
# letter appropriate to the grade.

# 2. Where there any parts of the question that don't make sense, if so write them down in complete sentences. 
# Im having difficulty with pieceing together how to code a system that will give
# a grade point average 

# 3. Please write down the keywords and phrases that will help you solve this problem ? 
# Numerical grade
# Letter grade
# Calculation

# 4. Does the problem provide you with any input data? Does it tell you what type of data your program needs to take in ?
# It tells to input a number; a numerical grade

# 5. Does the problem provide you with desired output data? Does it tell you that your program needs to give somthing back to the user ? 
# It tells you to out put a letter around the range of the appropriate

# 6. Using Pseudocode (fake code), write down Step by step how you think you can solve this problem. Remember, this does not have to be code.  
# Make a function 
# Use If else conditional statements.
# print()
# Arithmatic operator




# You are working on a game concept with several other engineers
#  and you need to provide them with a simple proof of concept.
#  For now, you have suggested that your game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop.
#  When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, the computer will randomly 
#  select one of the 3 options as well. Based on the results of a match,
#  Your program should conditionally determine who won, loss, or if it
#  was a draw based on the values. The game should only allow the player 
# to play 3 for 3 turns, and inform the player if the won or lost that match at the end
#  (this RPS game is a best of 2 out of 3 format.)

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
# The problem is asking me to make a program that randomly chooses between Rock, Paper, or scissors
# that also outputs the player's amount of wins

# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 
# Randomly selects
# 3 hands


# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?
# We need to be able to put in either RPC


# 4. What is the desired output ?
# If the player wins or lose 


# 5. Pseudocode Steps & Additional Notes 
# import Random 
# random.choice
# while loop
# if else conditionals
